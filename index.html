                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my e-Portfolio. My name is Ahmed Husain, and I am currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. This portfolio serves as a reflection of my 
                learning journey and professional development throughout the module. Research Methods and Professional Practice.</p>
                
                <p>Within this e-Portfolio, I intend to showcase a selection of key achievements and contributions made during the module. The content is organised into several sections. 
                    The first two sections provide an overview of my submitted assignments, highlighting both the research process and critical reflections. Following this, I will present 
                    some of the outputs and interpretations from the completed worksheets, demonstrating the application of data analysis skills developed throughout the module.</p>

                <h2>Assignment 1: Literature Review</h2>
                <p>For the first assignment of this module, I had to choose from a list of topics to produce a literature review on the chosen topic. I chose to focus on the use of Machine Learning (ML) in 
                    retail shop floor stock management. I believed this would suit what I’m currently studying and would be something that’s familiar for me. The aim of the literature review was to evaluate the 
                    current state of ML technologies being implemented into shop floor stock management and compare them to traditional methods. It was to also highlight opportunities and challenges that come with implementing such technologies.</p>

                <h3>Figure One</h3>
                <img src="images/One.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>One of the early decisions I made for this assignment was to limit and set the scope of the literature review. This is because the term “shop floor stock” could be applied to factory inputs, and 
                    I wanted to make it clear that this review would focus on retail stock management. This is personally because I thought the topic was more interesting and I hoped it would let me focus in on a specific topic in more detail.</p>

                <h3>Figure Two</h3>
                <img src="images/Two.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                    <p>Another important section which was early in the literature review, was to compare the current capabilities of ML technologies in stock management versus the traditional methods. 
                    I believe this section quickly gives the reader a clear image of how ML-based retail stock management is much more adaptive compared to traditional methods used in retail stock management.</p>

                    <p>This assignment was unique to me as it was very research focused and the objective was to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the current state of the topic, 
                    and the available information we have. Overall, I believe this assignment has helped with my research skills and has given me a clearer image, on the state of ML technologies in retail.</p>

                <h2>Assignment 2: Research Proposal</h2>
                <p>For the second assignment in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, I produced a 15-minute research proposal presentation talking about ML applications for small retail shops. The presentation built on the insights gained from first assignment, and I tried to choose a focused topic within the broader topic of ML applications in stock floor management. </p>

                <h3>Figure Three</h3>
                <img src="images/Three.jpg" alt="Figure One">
                
                <p>In the second slide of this presentation, I try to highlight the overall success of ML use in the broader retail space. I use this to justify further research into smaller retail shops since ML has been often found to be successful for bigger retailors.</p>
