                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my e-Portfolio. My name is Ahmed Husain, and I am currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. This portfolio serves as a reflection of my 
                learning journey and professional development throughout the module. Research Methods and Professional Practice.</p>
                
                <p>Within this e-Portfolio, I intend to showcase a selection of key achievements and contributions made during the module. The content is organised into several sections. 
                    The first two sections provide an overview of my submitted assignments, highlighting both the research process and critical reflections. Following this, I will present 
                    some of the outputs and interpretations from the completed worksheets, demonstrating the application of data analysis skills developed throughout the module.</p>

                <h2>Assignment 1: Literature Review</h2>
                <p>For the first assignment of this module, I had to choose from a list of topics to produce a literature review on the chosen topic. I chose to focus on the use of Machine Learning (ML) in 
                    retail shop floor stock management. I believed this would suit what I’m currently studying and would be something that’s familiar for me. The aim of the literature review was to evaluate the 
                    current state of ML technologies being implemented into shop floor stock management and compare them to traditional methods. It was to also highlight opportunities and challenges that come with implementing such technologies.</p>

                <h3>Figure One</h3>
                <img src="images/One.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>One of the early decisions I made for this assignment was to limit and set the scope of the literature review. This is because the term “shop floor stock” could be applied to factory inputs, and 
                    I wanted to make it clear that this review would focus on retail stock management. This is personally because I thought the topic was more interesting and I hoped it would let me focus in on a specific topic in more detail.</p>

                <h3>Figure Two</h3>
                <img src="images/Two.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                    <p>Another important section which was early in the literature review, was to compare the current capabilities of ML technologies in stock management versus the traditional methods. 
                    I believe this section quickly gives the reader a clear image of how ML-based retail stock management is much more adaptive compared to traditional methods used in retail stock management.</p>

                    <p>This assignment was unique to me as it was very research focused and the objective was to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the current state of the topic, 
                    and the available information we have. Overall, I believe this assignment has helped with my research skills and has given me a clearer image, on the state of ML technologies in retail.</p>

                <h2>Assignment 2: Research Proposal</h2>
                <p>For the second assignment in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, I produced a 15-minute research proposal presentation talking about ML applications for small retail shops. The presentation built on the insights gained from first assignment, and I tried to choose a focused topic within the broader topic of ML applications in stock floor management. </p>

                <h3>Figure Three</h3>
                <img src="images/Three.jpg" alt="Figure One">
                
                <p>In the second slide of this presentation, I try to highlight the overall success of ML use in the broader retail space. I use this to justify further research into smaller retail shops since ML has been often found to be successful for bigger retailors.</p>

                <h3>Figure Four</h3>
                <img src="images/Four.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>The next slide I’d like to focus on, is where I discuss the current state of ML implementation in small to medium enterprises (SMEs). The middle bullet point is the important one that shows that there has been success in implementing some ML technologies for SMEs. This further justifies the research proposal by showing that it is possible for some small retailors to benefit from ML implementation.</p>

                <p>Overall preparing for this proposal gave me better insights into the practical limitations of implementing ML in the real world, of retail shop floor stock management, especially in data-poor environments. This assignment also helped my presentation and communication skills, as I needed to clearly justify why I chose this research proposal, and why I believed this research was worth looking into.</p>

                <p>However, I do believe that I should’ve done more thorough research on the main topic of implementing ML in small retail shops. Most of what I discussed didn’t go too deep into any topic and remained surface level. I could’ve gone into more depth especially in the end of presentation after providing the viewer with a solid foundation on the topic. </p>

                <h2>Worksheets</h2>
                <p>During this module, I’ve also worked on some statistical worksheets, which included working with provided data sets. In this section, I’ll highlight some of the t-tests I’ve done on the data sets, and how I’ve interpreted them. I will also highlight some of the charts I produced for these worksheets and show my interpretations of the charts. All of this was done on Excel.</p>
              
                <h3>Figure Five</h3>
                <img src="images/Five.jpg" alt="Figure One">
                
                <p>To be clear on what we’re looking at. The related data set shows the incomes of 60 different men and women. The screenshot above shows a t-test being done to compare the means of these incomes and this can be used to determine which gender had a higher mean average.</p>

                <h3>Figure Six</h3>
                <img src="images/Six.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>The first step here is to develop a null hypothesis and then an alternative to it. The data from the first screenshot which was produced using Excel’s data analysis toolkit, provides evidence for or against the null hypothesis. </p>

                <h3>Figure Seven</h3>
                <img src="images/Seven.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>In the next screenshot, I interpret the results from the outputs and determine that the evidence suggests rejecting the null hypothesis in this case, which assumes that the mean income for males is equal or less than that of females. If we reject the null hypothesis then we assume the alternative hypothesis is correct which in this case, suggests that males earn more than females on average based on this data set. I also include some underlying assumptions made about the data set, which assumes the data inputs are all independent.</p>

                <p>The next dataset I worked with, was comparing the impurities between two agents. The dataset recorded two results for each agent, and the lower the impurities the better the agents were performing. </p>

                <h3>Figure Eight</h3>
                <img src="images/Eight.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>This is the null and alternative hypothesis I suggested for comparing the means between the agents. The null hypothesis assumes there is no difference and alternative hypothesis assumes there is a difference.</p>

                <h3>Figure Nine</h3>
                <img src="images/Nine.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>Here is the output of a t-test which compares the means of the agents. I interpret the results using a two-tailed test, which in this case I believed the evidence suggested that the null hypothesis was wrong, so there is a difference in the means of the agents.</p>

                <h3>Figure Ten</h3>
                <img src="images/Ten.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>The next t-test I did was using the same output but this time, I had to perform a one-tail test. I used the same output and used the one-tail results this time. I produced new hypotheses and determined that the evidence suggested that Agent 1 was more effective. This was a little different from the first t-test because the other t-test was mainly checking to see if there was a difference in the means, while this t-test was testing to see if Agent 1 was more effective or not.</p>

                <p>The next part of my worksheets included producing charts and interpreting them, I’ll go over these in this section.</p>

                <h3>Figure Eleven</h3>
                <img src="images/Eleven.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>The chart on the left was provided as an example. I produced the chart on the right. This was for a dataset that comparing brand preferences in two different areas.</p>

                <h3>Figure Twelve</h3>
                <img src="images/Two.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>I combined the charts for easier viewing.</p>

                <h3>Figure Thirteen</h3>
                <img src="images/Thirteen.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>The next screenshot shows my interpretation of the charts produced. Where I determine that Brand A is slightly more popular in Area 2 compared to Area 1 while Brand B is much more popular in Area 2 compared to Area 1.</p>

                <h3>Figure Fourteen</h3>
                <img src="images/Fourteen.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>This next output is produced using a dataset that checks how abundant/sparse/absent a certain species of Heather is in two different locations.</p>

                <h3>Figure Fifteen</h3>
                <img src="images/Fifteen.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>This is my interpretation of the produced chart.</p>

                <h3>Figure Sixteen</h3>
                <img src="images/Sixteen.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>This output is produced by looking at a dataset comparing how much weight two groups of people lost using two different diets.</p>

                <h3>Figure Seventeen</h3>
                <img src="images/Seventeen.jpg" alt="Figure One">

                <p>This was my interpretation of the histogram produced.</p>

                <p>Overall, working through these worksheets helped reinforce my understanding of statistical methods, the use of t-tests and producing charts, and then interpreting the results. These exercises improved my Excel skills, as that was the tool I used to produce all these outputs and charts. They’ve improved my ability to interpret statistical outputs and helped my ability to produce them using the appropriate tools.</p>
