                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my e-Portfolio. My name is Ahmed Husain, and I am currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. This portfolio serves as a reflection of my 
                learning journey and professional development throughout the module. Research Methods and Professional Practice.</p>
                
                <p>Within this e-Portfolio, I intend to showcase a selection of key achievements and contributions made during the module. The content is organised into several sections. 
                    The first two sections provide an overview of my submitted assignments, highlighting both the research process and critical reflections. Following this, I will present 
                    some of the outputs and interpretations from the completed worksheets, demonstrating the application of data analysis skills developed throughout the module.</p>

                <h2>Assignment 1: Literature Review</h2>
                <p>For the first assignment of this module, I had to choose from a list of topics to produce a literature review on the chosen topic. I chose to focus on the use of Machine Learning (ML) in 
                    retail shop floor stock management. I believed this would suit what I’m currently studying and would be something that’s familiar for me. The aim of the literature review was to evaluate the 
                    current state of ML technologies being implemented into shop floor stock management and compare them to traditional methods. It was to also highlight opportunities and challenges that come with implementing such technologies.</p>

                <p>One of the early decisions I made for this assignment was to limit and set the scope of the literature review. This is because the term “shop floor stock” could be applied to factory inputs, and 
                    I wanted to make it clear that this review would focus on retail stock management. This is personally because I thought the topic was more interesting and I hoped it would let me focus in on a specific topic in more detail.</p>
